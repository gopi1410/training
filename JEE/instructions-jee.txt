Instructions to build the first servlet:
----------------------------------------
Unzip tomcat in some folder
Launch eclipse and create a new "Dynamic Web Project"
Click on "Window"->"Preferences"-> server -> runtime environments
Click on "Add" button to add the tomcat server.
Specify the folder where you unzipped tomcat

Now right click project->properties->java build path->click on "libraires" tab
Click "Add Library" -> Server runtime -> select the tomcat server listed there
Now look at the PDF and create a servlet in a package such as com.mydomain.servlets
Right click the servlet -> run as -> run on server

Run tomcat on command line
-----------------------------------------
open command prompt
Change directory to your tomcat\bin folder
set JAVA_HOME=c:\program files\java\jdk8
(Make sure u put a proper existing folder path above)
type the command: startup.bat
It should popup a window that should stay open. Make sure eclipse server is stopped.
Now open browser and access "http://localhost:8080/"

-----------------------------------------
Create two html files
Form.html - pick up form code from the PDF
thankyou.html - Just some text such as <h2> Thank you for the info </h2>

Put these HTMLs into WebContent folder
You will be able to access these HTMLs from url
example: http://localhost:8080/Training/Form.html

Then try the servlet in Slide 15 of the PDF as a new servlet
Make sure the action="" attribute of the form points the servlet url

Change this:
request.getRequestDispatcher("thankyou.html").forward(request, response);

TO this:

response.sendRedirect("thankyou.html");

-----------------------------------------
Create a wizard
Form.html posts name and address to Servlet1
Servlet1 code is on page 12 of JEEWebNotes.pdf
When that UI is submitted, it goes to Servlet2
Servlet2 code is on page 13.

Change servlet2 to render the name and phone number to response instead of
forwarding to thankyou.html
-----------------------

Steps to start database:

open windows command prompt
cd c:\whereeverYouUnzippedDerby\db-derby-10.11.1.1-bin\bin
set DERBY_HOME=..\
setNetworkServerCP
startNetworkServer

For loops in JSP
----------------------------------------
<%for(int i=0; i< 10; i++){ %>
Thank you for submitting your data <%=request.getAttribute("name") %>
<% } %>
