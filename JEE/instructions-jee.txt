Instructions to build the first servlet:
----------------------------------------
Unzip tomcat in some folder
Launch eclipse and create a new "Dynamic Web Project"
Click on "Window"->"Preferences"-> server -> runtime environments
Click on "Add" button to add the tomcat server.
Specify the folder where you unzipped tomcat

Now right click project->properties->java build path->click on "libraires" tab
Click "Add Library" -> Server runtime -> select the tomcat server listed there
Now look at the PDF and create a servlet in a package such as com.mydomain.servlets
Right click the servlet -> run as -> run on server

Run tomcat on command line
-----------------------------------------
open command prompt
Change directory to your tomcat\bin folder
set JAVA_HOME=c:\program files\java\jdk8
(Make sure u put a proper existing folder path above)
type the command: startup.bat
It should popup a window that should stay open. Make sure eclipse server is stopped.
Now open browser and access "http://localhost:8080/"

-----------------------------------------
Create two html files
Form.html - pick up form code from the PDF
thankyou.html - Just some text such as <h2> Thank you for the info </h2>

Put these HTMLs into WebContent folder
You will be able to access these HTMLs from url
example: http://localhost:8080/Training/Form.html

Then try the servlet in Slide 15 of the PDF as a new servlet
Make sure the action="" attribute of the form points the servlet url

Change this:
request.getRequestDispatcher("thankyou.html").forward(request, response);

TO this:

response.sendRedirect("thankyou.html");
